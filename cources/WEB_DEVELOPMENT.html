                Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building
                 applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so.

                In data science, an algorithm is a sequence of statistical processing steps.
                 In machine learning, algorithms are 'trained' to find patterns and features 
                 in massive amounts of data in order to make decisions and predictions based on new data.
                  The better the algorithm, the more accurate the decisions and predictions will become 
                  as it processes more data.
                
                Machine learning has led to some amazing results, like being able to analyze medical
                 images and predict diseases on-par with human experts.</p>
